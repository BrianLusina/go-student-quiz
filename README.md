# Student Math quiz

A simple [Golang](https://golang.org/) math quiz that parses CSV file with math problems and their answers and times the student
as they answer the questions. This is a command line program that purely runs on Go.

## Pre-requisites

You will need [Golang](https://golang.org/) already setup. You can download it from the link provided.

Once you have that setup, build the application with:

```bash
go build <PATH TO PROGRAM>
./<BINARY GENERATED BY GO>
```
> <PATH TO PROGRAM> in this case is quiz/main.go
> <BINARY GENERATED BY GO> is `main`

Now you can run the program with:

```bash
> ./main --help
Usage of ./main:
  -csv string
        a csv file in the format of 'question, answer' (default "problems.csv")
       
```
> as the help suggests, you can pass in a path to the CSV file or use the default one [provided](./problems.csv)
